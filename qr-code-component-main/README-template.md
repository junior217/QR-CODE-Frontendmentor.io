## Overview
The project was to create a QR code page using Css and Html. Overall the project was at beginner level and very simple to complete. One must be able to discern the styles used by looking at the provided images provided by Frontend Mentor.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to style and center a container using CSS Flexbox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="container">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" class="qr-code">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects
    </h2>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
```
```css
body {
    height: 500px;
    margin: 135px auto;
    background-color: hsl(198, 65%, 90%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
}

```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

Next step I believe is to further brush up on my flex-box css and grid css methods. Im currently confident in flexbox but will continue to practice it untill it becomes second nature. Next I need to focus on layout and structing it prior to writing css in Html.



### Useful resources

- [Codeademy](https://www.codeacademy.org/) - Code Academy is a Website that teaches learners coding coding and they have a good intermediate Css Course. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
